Support for distributed-memory parallelism is via MPI, the Message Passing Interface. Support for spatial adaptivity is via [SAMRAI](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/SAMRAI), the Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Application Infrastructure, which is developed at the [Center for Applied Scientific Computing](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc) at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/).\r\n\r\nThis implementation of the IB method also makes extensive use of functionality provided by several high-quality third-party software libraries, including:\r\n\r\n -  [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc), the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation,\r\n -  [hypre](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/hypre/software.html), a library of high performance preconditioners that features parallel multigrid methods for both structured and unstructured grid problems,\r\n -  [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5), a general purpose library and file format for storing scientific data,\r\n -  [Blitz++](http://sourceforge.net/projects/blitz), a high-performance C++ array class library, and\r\n -  [Silo](https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo), a general purpose I/O library and file format for storing scientific data for visualization and post-processing.\r\n\r\nIBAMR outputs visualization files that can be read by the [VisIt Visualization Tool](https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit). Work is also underway to implement support for finite element mechanics models in IBAMR via the [libMesh](http://libmesh.sourceforge.net/) finite element library.\r\n\r\nWhat Is the IB Method?\r\n-\r\nThe immersed boundary (IB) method is a general-purpose numerical method for simulating fluid-structure interaction. The IB formulation of such problems uses an Eulerian description of the fluid and a Lagrangian description of the structure. Interaction equations that take the form of integral equations with delta function kernels couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian variables.\r\n\r\nFor general information about the IB method, see [http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin](http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/peskin). For visualizations of simulations that use IBAMR, see [http://cims.nyu.edu/~griffith](http://cims.nyu.edu/~griffith).\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n-\r\n1. [Download CMake] (http://www.cmake.org)\r\n2.
